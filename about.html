        <p>"Hello there! I'm MAHESH an undergraduate student pursuing Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at IIT
            Hyderabad. Being born and raised in Srikakulam, AndhraPradesh, education has been an integral part of my
            journey. I completed most of my schooling at Sri Chaitanya School. I successfully passed my 10th with an
            impressive marks from the AP State Board.
        </p>
        <p>
            Driven by my passion for knowledge, I continued my education at Sri Chaitanya, where I studied PCM (Physics,
            Chemistry, and Mathematics) in 11th and 12th grades. I worked hard and achieved an outstanding 976 in my
            Intermediate board exams. The culmination of my efforts led me to crack the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)
            with an
            All India Rank of '7558,' allowing me to fulfill my dream of joining IIT.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from academics, I have a vibrant set of hobbies that keep me engaged and motivated. In my free time
            you can find me at the Badminton Courts. It not only keeps me physically active but also
            provides a sense of peace and tranquility.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being an ardent bibliophile I often lose track of time, turning pages. I find solace in listening music of
            different genres. Beyond my hobbies, I have developed various skills along the way. I am also good at
            creating 3-D models
            using Solid Edge Software. Moreover, I have a good command of HTML and CSS, enabling me to craft visually
            appealing and
            functional web pages.
